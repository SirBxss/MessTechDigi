This project provides a set of Python scripts to clean and format Excel files. 
The main functionality includes deleting rows containing shapes, handling merged cells, identifying and formatting specific columns, and removing rows with empty IDs. 
Additionally, it allows searching for specific IDs and retrieving relevant rows.

This project is developed using two different approaches:

1. The first approach utilizes a variety of libraries to comprehensively tackle the challenges encountered in Excel files.
2. The second approach employs solely Pandas, which restricts access to certain tools and results in a less versatile implementation.
